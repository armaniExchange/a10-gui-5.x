Don't need npm install seprately, if you want works with client(the main project) , 
if you did npm install under those 2 folders,maybe will cause 
```
 Error: Invariant Violation: addComponentAsRefTo(â€¦): Only a ReactOwner can have refs.
```
But if you need only development those widgets, then you can install.
